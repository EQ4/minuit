  pattrstorage2minuit is a Max abstraction which allows to interconnect a pattrstorage object with the Virage sequencer on an IP network via UDP, using the Minuit requests specification.

  To install both the object and the maxhelp in Max5, just drag and drop the pattrstorage2minuit folder into the Max5/Cycling\'\ 74 folder : you may be prompted the authentification password of your computer account, and it's done !
